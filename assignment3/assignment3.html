    <h2>DOGS</h2>
    <P class="paragraph">People like dogs because they offer unconditional love, companionship, and loyalty. Dogs are
        known for being affectionate, often forming deep emotional bonds with their owners. Their playful nature,
        combined with their ability to understand human emotions, makes them great sources of comfort and joy. Dogs can
        also provide a sense of security and purpose, as they often serve as protectors and companions during walks or
        adventures. Additionally, the strong bond between humans and dogs has been reinforced over thousands of years,
        making them one of the most beloved pets worldwide.
